# Project Objective

- <span style="color: green;">Connect and transform raw data.</span>
- <span style="color: blue;">Build a relational data model.</span>
- <span style="color: orange;">Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.</span>
- <span style="color: red;">Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.</span>

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> To create a more lifelike experience, I've incorporated the Shimano logo into the project, simulating real-world conditions. This added authenticity and depth to the analysis.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> What is Shimano? Shimano, Inc, originally Shimano Iron Works and then Shimano Industries, Inc, is a Japanese multinational specializing in the manufacture of cycling components, fishing gear, and rowing equipment.

Furthermore, the project focused on in-depth sales data, complex product analysis, and understanding customer behavior. The inclusion of charts and visualizations added a new dimension to our insights, making sales, product, and customer details more understandable.

## Key Steps:

1. <span style="color: purple;">Data Transformation:</span> Successful import of data from CSV files, with various transformation techniques and creation of calculated columns.

2. <span style="color: purple;">Design of a Relational Data Model:</span> Database normalization, identification of fact and dimension tables, and establishment of primary and foreign keys.

3. <span style="color: purple;">Complex Calculations and DAX Measures:</span> Formulas created to gain a comprehensive view of KPIs and business performance.

4. <span style="color: purple;">Design of an Interactive Dashboard:</span> Creation of a powerful tool to analyze regional performance, product trends, and high-value customers.

5. <span style="color: purple;">Integration of Artificial Intelligence:</span> Addition of features such as question-answering, machine learning to understand the Moroccan Darija language ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦, anomaly detection, and reporting to enrich the project.

6. <span style="color: purple;">Optimization:</span> Streamlining processes to make the Power visualization faster and more efficient, ensuring the solution operates at its full potential.
