# Project Objective

- Connect and transform raw data.
- Build a relational data model.
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.
- Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.

**Note**: To create a more lifelike experience, I've incorporated the Shimano logo into the project, simulating real-world conditions. This added authenticity and depth to the analysis.

**Note**: What is Shimano? Shimano, Inc, originally Shimano Iron Works and then Shimano Industries, Inc, is a Japanese multinational specializing in the manufacture of cycling components, fishing gear, and rowing equipment.

Furthermore, the project focused on in-depth sales data, complex product analysis, and understanding customer behavior. The inclusion of charts and visualizations added a new dimension to our insights, making sales, product, and customer details more understandable.

## Key Steps:

1. Data Transformation: Successful import of data from CSV files, with various transformation techniques and creation of calculated columns.

2. Design of a Relational Data Model: Database normalization, identification of fact and dimension tables, and establishment of primary and foreign keys.

3. Complex Calculations and DAX Measures: Formulas created to gain a comprehensive view of KPIs and business performance.

4. Design of an Interactive Dashboard: Creation of a powerful tool to analyze regional performance, product trends, and high-value customers.

5. Integration of Artificial Intelligence: Addition of features such as question-answering, machine learning to understand the Moroccan Darija language ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦, anomaly detection, and reporting to enrich the project.

6. Optimization: Streamlining processes to make the Power visualization faster and more efficient, ensuring the solution operates at its full potential.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of data and analysis in driving business success. It showcased how transforming raw data into actionable insights can strengthen decision-making and lead to significant improvements. The combination of Power BI, data transformation, integration, and optimization created a powerful solution that will shape our future projects. ðŸš€ðŸš€
